# ![cui logo mini](https://i.imgur.com/8fLdRDY.png) CuoreUI.Winforms

This is a C# .NET Winforms library with **modern** controls, components and forms.

>[!TIP]
> [![image](https://i.imgur.com/rJ9l299.png) The repository](https://github.com/owtysm2/CuoreUI) receives updates quicker than the [![NuGet logo](https://i.imgur.com/6aPyVAg.png) NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CuoreUI.Winforms/) and may contain unfinished code.

## 🗿 Why use Cuore
> CuoreUI Showcases is an upcoming app where you can browse interactive samples.

**UI Design**

CuoreUI draws inspiration from web UI designs. Tries to support control animations, blur effects on controls, and rounded forms for a "modern" look.

![CuoreUI binary size in comparison to other libraries](https://i.imgur.com/7yeFZER.png)

**Lightweight**
*(Data from Early July 2025)*

While smaller in size than other competitors, it still packs similar features due to not being obfuscated and not having a license manager.

**Cautious with Resources**

We dispose classes inheriting `IDisposable`, and use memory efficiently.

The UI is drawn with the CPU, so we make sure to optimize that too.
